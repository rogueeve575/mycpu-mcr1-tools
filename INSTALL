If you'd like to compile any of this, you'll need to install my "common routines" library libkaty
under the 'dependencies' directory.

libkaty $ sudo ./go

The "go" script will install it easily on most Linux systems.



The "makegen" program is installed in the same manner. This is an old tool I use to generate Makefile
from the makelist.ml as well as some automatic function prototypes. It isn't really required to compile
any of the programs since the Makefile is already present, but is included for good measure.

The normal way to compile any of these is just:

$ makegen (optional)
$ make
$ ./[name of program]

You will need to

apt-get install build-essential libncurses5-dev

...to install the system headers required by the programs. For non Debian/Ubuntu distros,
it should just require gcc, and ncurses to build the emulator (and of course, libkaty).
