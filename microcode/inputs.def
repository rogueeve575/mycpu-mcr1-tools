	Defines inputs going into the ROM, mapping them to pin sets.
	Some names such as OPCODE are special builtins and are known to
	and handled by the compiler.
	
	For others, the option "conditional" can be added.
	This means that the input is something you can write in an "if"
	statement in the .mc. Microops will be written to all addresses
	corresponding to all combinations of conditionals for which they
	are relevant--this will normally be all conditionals unless the
	statement is in an "if" block placing conditions on the line.

/*	M27C160 is the microcode ROM part #.
	A0-A18, 16-bit output, two in parallel will give us 19 inputs and 32 outputs.
	Pin ordering:
		Inputs left: A18, A17, [A7-A0]
		Input right: A19, [A8-A16]
		Outputs left:  D0, D8, D1, D9, D2, D10, D3, D11
		Outputs right: D15, D7, D14, D5, D13, D5, D12, D4.
		VCC is in LR and GND is in middle left/right at pins 12&31
		/BYTE (pin 32), which is also VPP must be held high to keep it in 16-bit mode
