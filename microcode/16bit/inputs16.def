	Defines inputs going into the ROM, mapping them to pin sets.
	Some names such as OPCODE are special builtins and are known to
	and handled by the compiler.
	
	For others, the option "conditional" can be added.
	This means that the input is something you can write in an "if"
	statement in the .mc. Microops will be written to all addresses
	corresponding to all combinations of conditionals for which they
	are relevant--this will normally be all conditionals unless the
	statement is in an "if" block placing conditions on the line.
